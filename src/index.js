ðŸš¨Game OverviewðŸš¨

- The game is played in the browser
- The user is asked their name via the `prompt()` function. Their name is stored for later use.
- Questions and answers are stored in variables (only basic types are used).
- The user's score is initially zero. If they get the the answer correct, the score increases.
- The user submits their answers via the `prompt()` function.
- At the end of each answer, the score will either increase or stay the same, and the next question will appear.
- Once the user has answered all of the questions, an `alert()` function will trigger, letting them know their score given in the following format:

- **0-2** "Oh wow {name}, you can do better."
- **3-4** "Keep practicing {name}, you got this!"
- **5** "Wow {name}, a perfect score!"
